Short javascript code embedded in html to redirect based on browser language

This code is a simple javascript code wrapped in HTML in the case that you need to detect browser language without php. This code uses .includes so as to be able to find a general language without having to include all the different regions (ie. en-US or en-GB). This code simply looks for your input without having to have a direct match to language and region.

I found it useful to use as a landing page (index.html) that redirects to a language specific home page.

Please let me know if you have any questions or feedback, this is my first contribution. Thanks!
